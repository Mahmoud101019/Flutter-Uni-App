The true value behind knowledge is not accumulating it but knowing how to effectively use it and apply it in the right context. With that in mind, we actively push our students to tackle real-life case studies, projects, competitions, and experiences all while expanding their local and global knowledge from faculty with real-world expertise in tandem.Nevertheless, our stride towards excellence does not stop here, we make sure we give our students an edge through:Continuously applying innovative teaching tools that introduce students to practical applications, including international business simulations, experiential learning and game theory within the classroom.Regularly inviting industry leaders to share their experiences, journey and knowledge with our students in the classroom.Exploring beyond the boundaries of the class, the university, the country to a boundless global experience.We believe excellence is not destination",
